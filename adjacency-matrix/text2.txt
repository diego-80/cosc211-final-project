My project is a text analysis program that takes a body of text and outputs information about that text. This information will particularly focus on patterns in the text, such as alliteration and common words, phrases, and potentially even sentence structures.
The data for this project will be drawn from a body of text, read in from a file. It will likely be stored and used in multiple ways such as Strings, collections of Strings, arrays of chars, and potentially other sets of text.
The main data structure for this program will be a graph. Words (and potentially punctuation) will be vertices, and edges will describe the order of words, i.e. an edge from “alphabet” to “zoo” indicates that the phrase “alphabet zoo” appears in the text. Vertices and edges will likely also contain information on how many times a given word or edge appears.
